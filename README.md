## Instructions for running and viewing

Visit the deploy link: [here](https://tashiad.github.io/hang-in-there-boilerplate/ "Hang In There Deployed Site")

Upon visiting the site, you will see a motivational poster, generated from the randomization of a list of images, titles and quotes. By clicking the "Show Another Random Poster" button you can view a different randomized poster. If you like the poster shown and want to be able to view it later, click the "Save This Poster" button. Then click the "Show Saved Posters" button to view a grid of the saved posters you have chosen. From there, the "Back to Main" button will take you back to the main screen. Once back on the main screen, you can make your own poster by clicking the "Make Your Own Poster" button. This button will bring up the form, where you will input your own image link, title and quote of your choosing. Click "Show My Poster" to view it, if you like it you can repeat the steps from earlier to save it. Your inputs will be stored for possible randomized posters inputs in the future.

Future additional features will include the following:
From the saved posters view, if a user double clicks a saved poster, it will be deleted
Implement data validation and error handling into the form (disable button, provide error messages if data entered is not correct, etc)
In the main poster view, allow users to click each piece of the poster (image, title, quote) to update just that piece with another random item from the appropriate array
When a user single clicks a saved poster, create a modal to view it larger
Allow users to drag and drop saved posters into whatever order they want them to appear
