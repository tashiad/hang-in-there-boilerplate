## Project Goals
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript to store our data.

- Manipulate the page after it has loaded. Add, remove, and update elements on the DOM.
- Begin to understand the connection between HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Overview
Sometimes you need a pick me up. Remember those motivational posters that were all over the place in classrooms and online? Weâ€™re going to make our own!

## Instructions For Running and Viewing
**>>Visit the deploy link [here.](https://tashiad.github.io/hang-in-there-boilerplate/ "Hang In There Deployed Site")**

Upon visiting the site, you will see a motivational poster generated from a random of a list of images, titles, and quotes. Click _"Show Another Random Poster"_ to view a different randomized motivational poster.

If you like the poster shown and want to be able to view it later, click the _"Save This Poster"_ button. Then, click _"Show Saved Posters"_ to view a grid of the posters you've chosen to save. From there, the _"Back to Main"_ button will take you back to the main screen.

Once back on the main screen, you can make your own poster by clicking _"Make Your Own Poster"_. This will bring up the form, where you can enter an image link, title, and quote of your choosing. Click _"Show My Poster"_ to view it.

If you like it, you can repeat the steps from earlier to save it. Your inputs will also be stored for use in future randomized posters. If you decide you don't want a particular poster to be saved any longer, double click it and it will be deleted.

## Future Features
- Implement data validation and error handling into the form (disable button, provide error messages if data entered is not correct, etc)
- In the main poster view, allow users to click each piece of the poster (image, title, quote) to update just that piece with another random item from the appropriate array
- When a user single clicks a saved poster, create a modal to view it larger
- Allow users to drag and drop saved posters into whatever order they want them to appear
